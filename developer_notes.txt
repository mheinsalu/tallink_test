Exceptions handling based on recommendation in https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest/

Task's one requirement is to have functionality
Check conference	room availability	(based	on	registered	participants and	conference	room	max	seats)
Based on the additional information in the parentheses, I concluded that this function should not be checking whether the conference room is available (or already booked) as the text states but whether a conference has room for additional participants.

removeParticipant: should Participant be removed from Participant table if they are removed from Conference and are not registered to any other Conference?

Tests: no need to test/check if conference room exists when adding conference because the selection of rooms available to user in UI is fetched from DB

BindingResult handling in Controllers is duplicated code. Refactor?

Some info level logs can (should?) be changed to debug

Code checked with SpotBugs.

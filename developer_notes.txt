Exceptions handling based on recommendation in https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest/

Task's one requirement is to have functionality
Check conference	room availability	(based	on	registered	participants and	conference	room	max	seats)
Based on the additional information in the parentheses, I concluded that this function should not be checking whether the conference room is available (or already booked) as the text states but whether a conference has room for additional participants.

About ConferenceServiceImpl.addConference's line conference.setConferenceRoom(roomFromDb):
I don't like this. Since UI has selectable table of rooms that are fetched from db,
I want to be able to send room ID, save Conference to db nad have Conference.conferenceRoom populated on repo.find

removeParticipant: should Participant be removed from Participant table if they are removed from Conference and are not registered to any other Conference?

Tests: no need to test/check if conference room exists when adding conference because the selection of rooms available to user in UI is fetched from DB

TODO: It would be better to move findExistingConference from serviceImpls to RepoHelper but I don't have time to rewrite tests

Testing RepoHelper would be testing JpaRepository interface. Is this best practice?

TODO: should I set up test base with rooms and conferences?

BindingResult handling in Controllers is duplicated code. Refactor?

TODO: return JSON not string in controllers? return better message

Some info level logs can (should?) be changed to debug

Code checked with SpotBugs. Warning: Potential CRLF Injection for logs

Frontend based on https://medium.com/@mukundmadhav/build-and-deploy-react-app-with-spring-boot-and-mysql-6f888eb0c600
TODO: refactor frontend for cleaner code

From assignment.txt:
For	testing	RESTful	web	service	use	REST-assured	(https://code.google.com/p/rest-assured/)
For	testing	User	Interface	use	SeleniumHQ	(http://docs.seleniumhq.org/)
TODO: implement assignment testing recommendations

IT would be better to send less data from frontend to API e.g. don't need to send conference.participants when removing participant

TODO: frontend/js error jandling?

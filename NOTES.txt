Task's one requirement is to have functionality
Check conference	room availability	(based	on	registered	participants and	conference	room	max	seats)
Based on the additional information in the parentheses, I concluded that this function should not be checking whether the conference room is available (or already booked) as the text states but whether a conference has room for additional participants.
